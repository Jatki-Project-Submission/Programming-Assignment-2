# Programming-Assignment-2
CSC 3102 Programming Assignment #2

This Java project, Programming-Assignment-2, utilizes an AVL Tree data structure to manage and organize book orders. The system can insert, delete, and search for orders, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval using the self-balancing properties of the AVL tree.

## Overview

The **Programming-Assignment-2** reads book orders from a CSV file and stores them in an AVL tree for efficient management. Users can also manually add, remove, and search for orders through a command-line interface. The program provides a menu for interacting with the book orders, with options for adding new orders, removing existing ones, displaying orders, and fetching specific book details.

## Features

- **File Loading:** Reads book orders from a CSV file and loads them into an AVL tree.
- **AVL Tree Operations:** Efficient insertion, deletion, and in-order traversal using the AVL tree structure.
- **Command-line Interface (CLI):** Menu-driven CLI for easy interaction with the system.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find a book by order ID.
- **Order Management:** Add or remove orders with automatic AVL tree balancing.
- **Display Tree Information:** Shows the number of nodes and maximum height of the AVL tree.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** - Ensure Java 8 or above is installed.
- **IDE (Optional)** - You can use any Java IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code.
