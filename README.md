# Programming-Assignment-2
CSC 3102 Programming Assignment #2

Included are the two files necessary for the programming assignment, AVLTree.java and BookOrders.java. Feel free to work on whichever method you want, just be sure to let the groupme know so we don't double up and waste resources/time.

***Make sure to add the orders.csv file to your src folder so that it is accessible by the code.
